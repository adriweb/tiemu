| DESCRIPTION |
+-------------+

TiEmu is a program allowing a PC to emulate a TI89/92(+) hand-held. 
V200PLT and Titanium are working but may be somewhat buggy.
It works on Linux and Windows platforms actually.

It uses GTK+ (the Gimp ToolKit, http://www.gimp.org/gtk) for the GUI and
for the display. 

All link cables are supported by the link port: parallel, serial, 
Black TI Graph Link, Gray TI Graph Link and the SilverLink.

TiEmu is based on XTiger, the original TI emulator for Linux (see the AUTHORS file for 
more details) which uses the m68k emulation core from UAE (The Ultimate Amiga Emulator).
It also uses the TiLP framework (ti* libraries).


+----------+
| FEATURES |
+----------+

Some features:

o Easy to use thanks to a GUI developped with GTK+
o Nice debugger (source, memory, breakpoints, traps, vectors, stack, trace, ...)
o Ability to load/save the emulator state
o Full linkport emulation (all link cables: hardware, virtual)
o File linkport emulation (direct loading files)
o Works with 1/2/4 MB ROMS, 128 or 256 KB RAM
o Emulate both HW1 & HW2 (hW3 not supported yet)
o Can run from ROM dumps or FLASH upgrades
o Automatic ROM version/model detection
o Constrast emulated (try [Alt] + [+] & [-])
o Pretty fast emulation code
o Sreenshot of LCD and/or calculator in several images format (JPG/PNG/ICO)
o TI keyboard useable directly from PC keyboard or with the mouse on the skin
o Archive memory support as well as ghost spaces
o 4-level and 7-level grayscale support
o Can emulate at either the real speed of the calculator or the fastest the computer can handle.
o The letter keys are aliased to produce their respective letters.  No need to press the Alpha
  key, just type.
o A full-featured graphical debugger:
    * Code disassembly pane: disassembly, code breakpoints
    * Breakpoints pane: data, code, exceptions.
    	Data breakpoints can be set on a single byte,
      	word, or dword, or a range of addresses.
      Exceptions can be set on any one.
    * Registers pane: view and change the value of the registers.
    * Memory pane: view/edit values, disasm, searching of string/data.
    * PC trace pane: keep the latest executed instructions.
	* Stack: show the stack frame
    * Real time updates to the LCD, even with grayscale
	* and many other stuffs
o Keyboard mapping and menu shortcuts are fully VTi-compatible.

Limitations:

o Receiving from the virtual calculator is not implemented
o No logging capabilites yet

+---------------------+
| SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS |
+---------------------+

You will need a PC Intel (486) computer. A 100MHz processor is a minimum.
TiEmu uses roughly 10MB of RAM.


+-----------------------------+
| IMAGES (ROMDUMPS & UPGRADES |
+-----------------------------+

To run this emulator you will need an 'TiEmu v2' image. An image can be obtained from:
- a ROM dump,
- a FLASH upgrade (not applicable to TI92).

As ROM dumps are copyrighted by Texas Instruments Inc, they will never be distributed 
with the emulator. To get a ROM dump, you can use TiLP or any other ROM dumping program. 
TiLP may be interessant because it can be virtually linked with the emulator. 

If you can't get a ROM image (because you don't own the calculator or you want to test the emulator), 
you can download a FLASH upgrade from the TI web site (http://education.ti.com).

Please not that images converted from a FLASH upgrade (fake image) does not have boot 
block nor certificate. They are not as complete as ROM dumps (true image).

If you already have a ROM dump or an upgrade, place it in the 'images' directory. 
Make sure it has the right extension (.rom or .89u). It will be automatically converted.


+-----------------+
| HOW TO USE IT ? |
+-----------------+

When you launch it, TiEmu take some a while for initializing it. Once you 
have launched, you should see a window with the look of your calculator. 
You can either click with the left button on a TI key, either press the 
correspondant key of your PC keyboard.

Else, the right button of your mouse let you access a popup menu which contains
all you need for configuring/using the emulator.


+------------------+
| KEYBOARD MAPPING |
+------------------+

The keyboard mapping is the same as VTi, the well 
known TI emulator for Windows.

+-------------------+
| RIGHT BUTTON MENU |
+-------------------+

$$ To update $$

The right button menu give you access to the functionnalities of the emulator. If you let 
your mouse on the item during some while, a tooltip will appear.
This menu is organized as follow:

- Send file to TiEmu: directly load a file and transfer it into the emulator.
- Link options: for configuring a link cable to use for the linkport emulation.
- Config: load/save the current configuration in the config file (~/.tiemu ou tiemu.ini). The current state is not saved but loaded if it has been previously saved.
- Calculator state: save/load the current state or load the latest saved stated
- Enter debugger: see the DEBUGGER section further in the text
- Reset calc: reset the calculator (RAM, FLASH: all !).
- Emulator options: 
	
Speed: for tuning TiEmu. Only the 'Sync' item is implemented.
Number of colors: allows you to choose the number of grayscales.
Screen: with the  normal/large items, you can modify the size of the application window. Useful if you are working with high resolution. The same effect can be got by resizing the window with the mouse. 
The fullscreen item switch in fullscreen mode. You can also press 'Alt+Enter' for toggling the full-screen mode.

- Skin for current calc: you can choose to display the emulator with a skin or only the LCD display. You can change for a compatible skinn, too.
- Screenshot: do a screenshot of the LCD display. The screenshot file is automatically incremented.
- RAM: dump the RAM content into a file. The file is a text file and contains
an hexadecimal & character dump.
- ROM:

Dump ROM: dump the ROM content into a file. The file is a text file and contains an hexadecimal & character dump. Beware, this may take some time and space disk for writing the file (roughly 10 MB).
Add image/upgrade: add a file to the list of images/upgrades (see below).
Set ROM: choose a file to load. It can be a true ROM image or a FLASH upgrade.
If you select a FLASH upgrade, TiEmu will dislpay a choice: either convert the upgrade into a fake ROM image (for using the upgrade as a new ROM image), either load the upgrade for FLASHing your calc.
- Help: display the logo and the license as well as misc informations.
- Infos: some informations about the calc and the developper
- Exit and save state: save the current state and quit
- Exit without saving state: exit immediately without saving the curren state.


+--------------------+
| LINKPORT EMULATION |
+--------------------+

TiEmu emulates the linkport in two ways:
- through an external link cable
- from file

With a link cable, TiEmu can communicate with the hardware (parallel, serial, ... link cable) or 
virtually (TiLP, VTi, another TiEmu/VTi application).

Remark about virtual links: you have the choice between the TiEmu and the VTi virtual link.
For Windows users: the Vti virtual link allows you to make TiEmu 
communicate with VTi. It provides also a different linking method of the 
TiEmu virtual link.
For Linux users: the 2 possible virtual link are useable.
Simply choose the best or the fastest.

For the TiEmu virtual link, the emulator must be set on the channel #0 and the linking program on the channel #1.

TiEmu can load files directly from disk without using any linkink program. 
To send a file to the emulator, press F10 or enter the popup menu. Useful and fast !


+----------+
| DEBUGGER |
+----------+


To enter the debugger, you can press F11 at any time. This will stop the emulation engine but
the LCD is still refreshed.
The debugger is made up of several windows which can be moved and resized (TiEmu save/restore these settings):
- source code
- registers
- memory
- breakpoints
- PC trace
- stack
Please note these windows are automatically refreshed when a change occurs from another window.

From the source code window, you can view disassembly code, set code breakpoints and do classical 
debugging actions (step in/over/out, run, break, etc). Right click to get popup menu.

With the registers window, you can view and modify registers content. 
When a register is updated, it's colored.
To edit register content, click value. To view memory at the register content, right click.

The memory window is made up of tabs. Each tab show a memory dump with address, data and ASCII.
You can add/remove tabs from toolbar as well as browsing memory with the arrows.
Right click to get popup menu which will allow you to search ASCII strings or data.

The breakpoints window displays pending breakpoints. Breakpoints can be put on:
- source code (from the source code window only),
- exceptions (all exception from 0 to 255 which includes traps, autoints)
- memory access (read/write & byte/word/long)
- memory range access

The PC trace shows the PC execution history. Enabling this feature is more CPU intensive.

The stack frame window displays active stack and stack content.

At the time being, there is no logging capabilities.

| SCREENSHOTS |
+-------------+

Simply press F9 for doing a screenshot with the current options. The different options can be easily 
modified in the 'Screenshot options' dialog box. In this box, you can choose between:
- different image types (color or b/w), 
- LCD only or full skin,
- image format (JPEG, PNG, ICO).

The screenshot filename is build from the pattern (foo) and an auto-incrementing counter (XYZ).
Result: fooXYZ.png.


+--------------+
| COMMAND LINE |
+--------------+

All the informations about the command line and the configuration file format 
(~/.tiemu or tiemu.ini) are available in:
-  the manpage for the Linux users ('man tiemu'),
-  the Manpage.txt file for the Windows users.
