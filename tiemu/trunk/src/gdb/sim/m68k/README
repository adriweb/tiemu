This is the m68k simulator directory.

It is still work-in-progress.  The code in this directory borrows
heavily from the ../sim/sh directory and the Un*x Amiga Emulator, both
GPL'ed pieces of software. The framework to interface the simulator
comes from ../sim/sh and the core m68k emulator is from UAE.

The UAE software can be obtained from:

http://www.freiburg.linux.de/~uae/

The integration has been done in such a manner to avoid making changes
to the the machine-generated files and code that produces the
machine-generated files. This allows future enhancements to the core
m68k emulator to be easily shared between UAE and this simulator.

The initial integration of the the m68k emulator was performed by
William Cohen (wcohen@redhat.com) and DJ Delorie (dj@redhat.com).
