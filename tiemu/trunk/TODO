Planned features:


- add SilverLink support
- test real link support
- add GUI front-end to GDB
- ...

- A strange behavor of the dropdown list for the ROM Calls: just after
having started TiEmu, when I sort the symbols, I need to click 2 times
on the arrow to see the list of symbols. This only happens just after
a sort, and it disappears completely once characters are entered in
the text field.

- "Disable breakpoint" doesn't work on data breakpoints of type "range".
