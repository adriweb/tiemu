Planned features:

* store *.sav files in the images folder or a new folder like 'states' rather than in the {app} folder
* use the contrast field of skin
+ select target folder for screenshots
* i18n (internationalization support)
* sound emulation

bug #1529250: oh, and a little *Wish List:
1. Taking animated screenshots using TiEmu (integrated)
2. Allowing the user to change the folder after you use
F10 to transfer file from the pc to the emulator
3. Allow Drag and Drop, like VTI

bug #1471709  	  crash on old .sav load
bug #1529247  	  Link problem sending file from tiEmu to PC

req #1532860		Video ScreenCapture

Another cool feature would be the capabilitie to
capture video from the screen, allowing to save in .gif
or .avi
