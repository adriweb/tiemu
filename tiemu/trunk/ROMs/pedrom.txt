The precompiled TIB is PedRom re-built by Kevin in order to remove non-free parts:
<<
 I finally removed all GPL-incompatible code from PedroM:
* TIB Receiver: deleted without replacement. We need receiving code:
- licensed under a GPL-compatible license
- compatible with the Voyage 200 and the TI-89 Titanium
- without any AMS unprotection hacks, since PedroM can unprotect the FlashROM cleanly
none of which is true for the TIB Receiver. ExtendeD, is there any chance you can provide a version of FreeFlash without the Flash unprotection under the GPL for PedroM? Or is that infeasible for some technical or other reason?
* ttunpack: deleted without replacement. PPGs can be run the same way you'd run them on AMS: using the launcher included with the program.
* bitmap routines from ExtGraph: rewritten (based in part on the sprite routine I wrote for Backgammon). Contrary to the previous hack, my implementation is clipped. I submitted the rewritten routines to PpHd. They could use more testing though, I warned him about that and I guess we'll see who gets around to testing them first.
* deleted builtin stdlib archive pack. Just send the file, it ships with PreOs.
* deleted WTI support (the interface code is under a very restrictive license, and WTI was never publicly released)
