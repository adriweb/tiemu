REQUIREMENTS
------------

 - a PC with a 450MHz Pentium-class processor and 32MB of RAM
 - a Windows computer: Windows 95/98/Me or Windows NT4/2000/XP/Vista (better)
 - the GTK+ 2.6 libraries
    Location: <http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/gladewin32/gtk-win32-2.6.8-rc1.exe?download>
 - the SilverLink driver v3.5 if you have a SilverLink cable
	Location: http://www.ticalc.org/pub/win/link/tiglusbinf3.zip
	=> It is now installed in the TiEmu folder by the installer.
	
Note: if you are using 'The GiMP', you may encounter DLL's problems...
		The GTK+ package (1) provided with the GiMP may not be fully compatible with one used by TiLP/TiEmu.
		On the other hand, the package (2) requested by TiLP/TiEmu is compatible with the GiMP.
		Thus, if you are using The GiMP, you are strongly encouraged to uninstall (1) and install (2).


NOTES
-----

1°) This setup may download & install some extra libraries (GTK+ 2.6). 

The GTK+ package includes the Wimp (Windows IMPersonator) theme engine which gives 
Windows look & feel (includes XP theming). Is also included the GTK theme selector.
You may need to use it on non-NT systems if you get a lot of warnings about a font. 
Simply disable the WiMP theme for another one.

2°) If anyone is getting one of these:
- ** WARNING **: Couldn't load font "MS Sans Serif 8" falling back to "Sans 8"
- ** ERROR **: file shape.c line 75: assertion failed: (glyphs->num_glyphs > 0)
or any other warning or error message regarding fonts/glyphs, the fix is to
open your C:\Program Files\Shared Files\Gtk\2.0\etc\gtk-2.0\gtkrc and to add this:
	style "user-font"
	{
	font_name="Arial"
	}
	widget_class "*" style "user-font"
This forces GTK+ to use a compatible font (Arial) and reportedly fixes both
the aforementioned problems, and probably others too.

3°) If you are getting any errors with DLLs, such as "The procedure entry point
atk_relation_set_add_relation_by_type could not be located in the dynamic link
library libatk-1.0-0.dll", make sure you have one and only ONE version of the
GTK+ DLLs. If unsure, remove all GTK+ packages and install it again.

4°) This setup will copy the LPG's SilverLink driver (http://lpg.ticalc.org/prj_usb):
it is now provided with TiLP and available in the 'slvdrv98'/'slvdrvXP' folder.

Simply plug your link cable: Windows should detect a new device. 
But, you still have to manually install it by requesting an update of driver and
specifying driver files location to force installation.

You can install driver at any time (that is to say before or after TiLP installation).

Given that the LPG SilverLink driver has a Release date more recent than the Texas
Instruments OEM driver, this driver will be used prior to the TI one.

5°) This setup will install the PortTalk driver (Windows NT4/2000/XP machines).
This step may require an administrator account (at least for NT4).
You will need to REBOOT your machine after installation (if you plan to 
use a parallel or serial link cable).

PortTalk copyright (http://www.beyondlogic.org):

6°) The tiemu3-nogdb setup will install the GNU's 'wget' utility for download of GTK+
(http://xoomer.virgilio.it/hherold/).

USAGE
-----

The installer automatically creates program entries in the Windows Startup menu.
