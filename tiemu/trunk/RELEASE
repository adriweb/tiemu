				[ Release notes for TiEmu3 ]



Previous version: 3.00		(14/05/2007)
Current version:  3.01		(??/06/2007)

SubVersion (CVS) revision: $Id: RELEASE 2042 2006-05-07 07:46:23Z roms $

TiEmu is available for 3 platforms:
Linux (GTK), Windows (GTK), Mac OS X (GTK)

[ If you have a SilverLink cable (TI-GraphLink USB) and you are running Windows,
you will need to retrieve a Win32/Win64 driver from the Linux Programmer Group 
website at <http://lpg.ticalc.org/prj_usb>. Linux and Mac OS X no longer need a
driver, instead the userspace libusb library is used. ]

[ In order to use TI's BlackLink serial cables or home-made serial or parallel
cables on any NT-based version of Windows (Windows NT 4, Windows 2000, Windows
XP, Windows 2003 or any newer version of Windows), you'll need to install the
DhaHelper driver. The installer for TiEmu 3 without GDB installs this driver
automatically. The installer for TiEmu 3 with GDB currently doesn't. ]

An easy way to install the above drivers is to install TiLP 2 for Windows.
For the other link cables / operating systems, no driver is needed.


New capabilities:
-----------------

	- sound emulation
	- breakpoints on bit change

	

Improvements:
-------------

	- data/bit change breakpoint is raised after instruction execution so fixed disassembly window 
		to show one line before current PC
	- optimized displaying/refreshing of debugger windows (~50%)
	- allow double-clicking of a ROM instead of selecting + pressing OK button
		
		
Bug fixes:
----------

	- time handling (really use wall time, not CPU time, for RTC on *nix)
	- fixed coordinate saving for Win32 multi-monitor case
	- *nix compile fix: fixed KDE path detection for multilib systems with
	                    both 32-bit and 64-bit libraries installed
	- fixed wrong disassembly offset of MOVEM.W instruction
	
	
Notes:
------

	- pressing Ctrl+Alt+Del makes TiEmu unresponsive. Press Ctrl again...
