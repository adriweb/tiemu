SubVersion (CVS) revision: $Id$

TiEmu is available for 3 platforms:
Linux (GTK), Windows (GTK), Mac OS-X (GTK)

[ If you have a SilverLink cable (TI-GRAPH LINK USB), you will need to retrieve
a Linux/Win32/Mac OS-X driver on the Linux Programmer Group at 
<http://lpg.ticalc.org/prj_usb>. ]

For the other link cables, no driver is needed.
