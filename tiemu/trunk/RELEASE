			[ Release notes ]



Previous version: 1.80k		(20/01/2005)
Current version:  1.80l		(06/02/2005)

SubVersion (CVS) revision: $Id$

TiEmu is available for 2 platforms:
Linux (GTK), Windows (GTK).

If you have a SilverLink cable (TI-GRAPH LINK USB), you will need to retrieve
a Linux/Win32/Mac OS-X driver on the Linux Programmer Group at 
<http://lpg.ticalc.org/prj_usb>.

For the other link cables, no driver is needed because it's provided.


New capabilities:
-----------------

	- rewrite of the m68k loop:
		* UAE fixed to handle multiple pending interrupts and some other fixes
		* idle mode and STOP improved but problems with ON key
	- added kbd_dbg variable in tiemu.ini file to display keystrokes in console (useful for creating keymaps).


Improvements:
-------------

	- linkport (D-Bus)
	- boosted linkport speed (direct file)
	- switched to GTK+ package 2.4-rc26 (2.4.14): compatible with GiMP and fixes toolbar tooltips
	- main loop modified: main loop is restarted whenever a new ROM is loaded.
	- fixed main window which appears when the whole window is ready
		

Bug fixes:
----------

	- fixed grayscale routines: they are now rock-stable !
	- fixed grayscales with HW2 (still use HW1 routine thru VTi detection)
	- implemented 'increment rate' of $600017 port
	- fixed AI3: it was never raised because counter was never incremented
	- port $700014 (Real Time Clock) is incremented every 8192 seconds
	- linkport has been fixed and improved (EA bit on AMS >= 2.08)
	- progress bars for linkport fixed
	- fixed size of handles in handle wnd
	- fixed AI2 (need to be raised whenever a key is pressed)
	- fixed V200 and Titanium crash under Linux (buffer overflow). V200 transfers don't crash
		any more under Windows (probably same bug).


To do:
------

	- implement the HW2 Protection (HW1 protection if almost complete)
	- implement the RTC introduced with AMS 2.09
