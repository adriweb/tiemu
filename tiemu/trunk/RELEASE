	(seems to be needed with latest lib-usb release...)
	- ParallelLink support was not compiled under Windows
	- reset SilverLink cable when opened (like other cables)
	- close/re-open cable in slv_reset. Reseting is not enough on both Linux & Windows.

	- error message is a glib allocated string for now.
	- moved transcode support as deprecated (superseded by ticonv libary)
	- switched to ticonv
	- removed deprecated functions
	- free the block itself in tifiles_content_delete_xxxxx
	- clean-up (removed dead code)

		instead of file size (TI8x FLASH file format)
	- fixed bug in tifiles_file_is_tib which didn't detect TIB files.
* libticalcs2 changes (roms):
	- error message is a glib allocated string for now.
	- switched to ticonv library

	- fixed TI73 sending & receiving of FLASH apps
	- fixed OS version formatting
	- set hw revision to -1 (n/a) for TI8x calcs

	- fixed bug in TI92 recv_backup
	- added periodic refresh from callbacks
	- bitmap for screenshot is now allocated at the end of transfer.
	- work on DirectLink in progress.
	- implemented USB hand-helds support
	- split sending of FLASH app & os into 2 functions.
	- renamed some function of the API (send/recv_flash into send/recv_app)
	- make ticalcs_dirlist_mem_used useable with apps tree
	- implemented get_memfree functions
	- added a new probing method for USB hand-helds only (faster)
	- added FTS_BACKUP flag for hand-helds with real backup capability
	- added common function which emulates a backup by grouping
	- definitely fixed return value for probing functions
	- implemented a garbage collector for virtual packets, calc attributes anc calc parameters.
		Needed because a DUSB function may returns an error without releasing allocated memory
		(easier by this way).
	- added ticalcs_dirlist_flash_used which count memory used by both archived variables and apps
	- fixed pbar with TI73/84+ sending of FLASH app
	- fixed ca_del_array & cp_del_array for garbage collector
	- manage hand-held error codes
	- manage delaying packets

	- implemented feature request: "TiLP always gets a list of the files on the calc, even if I already " (T. Evans)
	- when ticables/ticalcs error occurs: reset cable and wait for 0.5s (i/o link active -> disappear)
	- don't use cable_handle & calc_handle fields: they are private
	- fixed command line
	- added skip/retry/cancel box when sending of multiple files

* libticables2 changes (roms):
	- modified TiEmu virtual link for Windows: don't use .shared section 
	any more. This breaks compat with older revision of the library but

			internal fields in FileContent structure (make them opaque/private)
	- added full TiGroup (*.tig) support: read, write, list
	- removed a limitation in 'tifiles_group_contents': the src content is now
		fully copied (not limited to first element like single file)

	- [roms]  $1757: fixed v200 skin (blank LCD)
	- [kevin] $1763: fix HeapTable detection on PedroM 0.81 RC9 (use ROM_CALL instead of hack for
	                 PedroM >=0.81)
	- [kevin] $1764: import PedroM (ld-tigcc build) 0.81 RC9
	- [roms]  $1768: merge changes from tiemu-3-libti2 branch:

	                 in the NSIS installer
* The libticables, libtifiles and libticalcs packages and the TiLP Fedora RPM are now from libti*2 and
  TiLP II development. This means there were major changes, mostly in the internals (parts of the libs and

  by TiEmu, and that TiLP has a revamped interface.

20050806:
* Changes from TiEmu trunk:
	- [roms] $1543: fixed 'Receive file' check item.
	- [roms] $1544: fixed bug #1227179 (screenshot).
	- [roms] $1552: replaced my hand-made about box by the generic one provided with GTK 2.6
	- [roms] $1560: TiEMu can be exited from the cross (WM)
	- [roms] $1564: fixed 'backing pixmap problem' (bug #1227433): the scale factor
		was not retrieved fine from .ini file when the ratio contains ',' instead of '.'
	- [kevin] $1572/1573: handle program entry breakpoints on _main for kernel/Fargo programs
	- [kevin] $1574/1575: implemented HW3 RTC

	- [roms] $1585: fixed comm box (removed calc & autodetect because un-needed)
	- [roms] $1586: fixed file patterns in file selector (case sensitivity)
	- [roms] $1588: avoid linkport accesses when browsing memory from dbg window
	- [roms] $1590: fixed severe bug in linkport (the status register was reset whenever read
		like specified by TI but the int handler proves it's false).
		TiEmu does not run an infinite loop when transfer is interrupted.
	- [roms] $1593: previous bug fixed again for _all_ calcs
	- [roms] $1597: set link timeout to 60s for non-NT platforms, 1.5s for others

	- [roms]  $1627: put all gscales extern into gscales.h
* Support for BSS section debugging (_nostub only at the moment). TIGCC 0.96 Beta 5 required.
* Avoid link port access when browsing memory in the Insight memory window as well (see $1588 above).
* Upgrade GTK+ for the Windows binaries to 2.6.8.
* Rebuild FC4 RPMs with the latest FC4 update GCC.
* FC4 RPMs no longer have a Conflicts: insight, because they don't conflict with Gerard Milmeister's Insight packages
* FC4 RPMs now build itcl/itk/iwidgets shared and provide them rather than conflicting with them.
* TiEmu, TiLP (roms): Added fvisibility support for GCC 3.4.2-rhl or 4.0 and higher
* Disabled fvisibility support if --enable-shared or --enable-shared-* because it is currently broken.
* libti*, TiLP (roms): Fixed GCC 4 pointer signedness warnings.
* libti* (PpHd): Fixed --enable-nls builds.
* libticables (roms): "Low-level access cable functions may be set to NULL on some cables: set to nul_cable instead." Was not done for the Gray Link !
* libticables (jb): Add a generic fallback case for all Linux hosts.
* libticables (roms): Removed arm/ipaq check for libusb removal. Can be removed by configure option.
* libticables (roms): Added ticable_link_reset function (needed by TiEmu for proper operation and present in ticables2).
* libticalcs (roms): Fixed possible buffer overflow with recv_packet (usually occurs with virtual links because the received length is invalid).

* libticables (roms): AVR link support removed, baud_rate no longer exported
* libtifiles (roms): The file signature is now case-insensitive.
* TiLP (jb): Added EPS and PDF output for the screenshot.

	                      (source: 68knotes.txt by Bart Trzynadlowski)
* added support for disassembling ER_throw (rev 1357, trunk backport pending)
* updated libticables and libtifiles version numbers (roms)
