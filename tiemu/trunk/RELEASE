				[ Release notes for TiEmu3 ]



Previous version: 3.01		(01/09/2007)
Current version:  3.02		(15/12/2007)

SubVersion (CVS) revision: $Id: RELEASE 2042 2006-05-07 07:46:23Z roms $

TiEmu is available for 3 platforms:
Linux (GTK), Windows (GTK), Mac OS X (GTK)

[ In order to use TI's BlackLink serial cables or home-made serial or parallel
cables on any NT-based version of Windows (Windows NT 4, Windows 2000, Windows
XP, Windows 2003 or any newer version of Windows), you'll need to install the
DhaHelper driver. The installer for TiEmu 3 without GDB installs this driver
automatically. The installer for TiEmu 3 with GDB currently doesn't. ]

An easy way to install the above drivers is to install TiLP 2 for Windows.
For the other link cables / operating systems, no driver is needed.

	- [no-gdb] reject computed value [%lX] at end of line rather than in the middle of the instruction
	- in the bkpts window, the fifth toolbar button (go to address) is not restricted to code

	- [no-gdb] fixed "movem.l #$unreadable_mask"
	- [gdb] Insight's GDB console is not shown by default anymore (less window clutter)
