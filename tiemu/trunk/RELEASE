* libti*-2 (roms): fixed MinGW module filenames
* libtifiles-2 (roms): fixed loading of TIB files

20050914:
* Snapshots now come from the new TiEmu trunk (TiEmu 3), as the tigcc-debugging-branch has been merged
  into the trunk and closed.
* List of changes:
	- [roms]  $1629: added new I/O ports window which let view/modify HW registers
	- [roms]  $1648: fixed buffer overflow in RTC HW3 and disabled full screen mode (too slow)
	- [kevin] $1662/1663: import V200 updates as HW2, not HW1 (and default TI-89/92+ updates to HW2)
	- [roms] $1666: use Titanium and V200 skins when available (else fallbacks)
	- [roms] $1667: fixed large column in the I/O port view
	- [roms] $1668: new function in the mem window (read address and dis-assemble at)
	- [roms] $1672: fixed 'Set PC to selection' command by adding a call to fill_prefetch_slow()
	- [roms] $1673: update ASCII column (dbg wnd) after cell editing
	- [roms] $1676: ask for 'Clear RAM' when reseting calc (O. Armand request)
	- [kevin] $1680/1681: fix buffer underflow in iodefs.c
	- [roms] $1689: fixed Titanium skin loading and fixed bug in skin loader
	- [roms] $1692: re-enabled transient mode for windows
	- [roms] $1694: set transient mode as option
	- [kevin] $1695: merge changes from tigcc-debugging-branch into the trunk, snapshots now come
	                 from the trunk
	- [kevin] $1705: import PedroM (ld-tigcc build) 0.81 RC8
	- [kevin] $1707: fix handling of handles (don't interpret NULL as end of heap table, don't
	                 dereference H_NULL in loops)
	- [kevin] $1708: disable window grouping (transient mode) by default
	- [kevin] $1710: fix size of archived handles under PedroM
	- [kevin] $1711: bump version number (2.00->2.80) and GTK+ requirement in configure.ac
	                 (2.4.0->2.6.0, GTK+ 2.4 won't work since the addition of the new about window)
	- [kevin] $1712: install prebuilt Manpage.txt if groff is not available
	- [kevin] $1713: fix RELEASE window (MinGW path, say "TiEmu" instead of "TiLP", not
	                 automatically shown so don't say it is)
	- [kevin] $1717: fix RELEASE file to display properly (use ASCII, not Latin1 which is not
	                 valid UTF-8)
	- [kevin] $1718: don't remove last 2 bytes of RELEASE and COPYING (only Manpage.txt needs that)
	- [kevin] $1719: fix patch to install prebuilt Manpage.txt without groff so it also works with
	                 groff available (can't put conditional around install-data-local)
	- [roms] $1727: fix bug in direct link access
	- [roms] $1739: update HTML manual
	- [kevin] $1741: update version number in popup-2.glade
	- [kevin] $1742: fix FlashROM writes: can't set bits from 0 to 1
	- [roms]  $1744: fixed FlashReadLong & FlashWriteLong (long access is just 2 word accesses)
	- [roms]  $1748: don't allow operations on state while the debugger is opened (bug item #1250175).
	- [roms]  $1757: fixed v200 skin (blank LCD)
	- [kevin] $1763: fix HeapTable detection on PedroM 0.81 RC9 (use ROM_CALL instead of hack for
	                 PedroM >=0.81)
	- [kevin] $1764: import PedroM (ld-tigcc build) 0.81 RC9
	- [roms]  $1768: merge changes from tiemu-3-libti2 branch:
		* switched to the TiLP-II framework
		* updated the communication/device dialog box
		* added a new pseudo-cable (internal linkport)
		* modified tiemu.ini parser consequently
		* changed getw/putw into get_w/put_w due to name conflict with stdio.h.		
		* SilverLink cable is now working for both Linux & Windows.
	- [kevin] $1771: update NSIS installer, tarball script and Fedora RPM specs, require GTK+ 2.6.10
	                 in the NSIS installer
* The libticables, libtifiles and libticalcs packages and the TiLP Fedora RPM are now from libti*2 and
  TiLP II development. This means there were major changes, mostly in the internals (parts of the libs and
  most of TiLP have been rewritten). The main user-visible changes are that the SilverLink is now supported
  by TiEmu, and that TiLP has a revamped interface.

20050806:
* Changes from TiEmu trunk:
	- [roms] $1543: fixed 'Receive file' check item.
	- [roms] $1544: fixed bug #1227179 (screenshot).
	- [roms] $1552: replaced my hand-made about box by the generic one provided with GTK 2.6
	- [roms] $1560: TiEMu can be exited from the cross (WM)
	- [roms] $1564: fixed 'backing pixmap problem' (bug #1227433): the scale factor
		was not retrieved fine from .ini file when the ratio contains ',' instead of '.'
	- [kevin] $1572/1573: handle program entry breakpoints on _main for kernel/Fargo programs
	- [kevin] $1574/1575: implemented HW3 RTC
	- [roms]  $1577: can choose HW1/HW2 when importing a tib file
	- [kevin] $1580/1581: fixed about box license display on MinGW
	- [roms] $1583: fixed PPhD's bug (no reload of ROM calls when upgrading)
	- [roms] $1585: fixed comm box (removed calc & autodetect because un-needed)
	- [roms] $1586: fixed file patterns in file selector (case sensitivity)
	- [roms] $1588: avoid linkport accesses when browsing memory from dbg window
	- [roms] $1590: fixed severe bug in linkport (the status register was reset whenever read
		like specified by TI but the int handler proves it's false).
		TiEmu does not run an infinite loop when transfer is interrupted.
	- [roms] $1593: previous bug fixed again for _all_ calcs
	- [roms] $1597: set link timeout to 60s for non-NT platforms, 1.5s for others
	- [roms] $1598: added a new function in the ticables library API (ticable_link_reset)
		for use by TiEmu. It allows to reset/flush the pipes of virtual linking when the
		DBus is reset (usually due to transmission error). Link is now resumable.
	- [roms] $1601: reimplemented HW3 RTC from latest/new O. Armand's information.
	- [roms] $1608: automatically bind TiEmu #2 on the second instance of TiEmu
	- [roms] $1615: TiEmu retains the state of dbg windows (open/closed) now.
	- [kevin] $1623/1624: fixed: only first 32 bytes of ram_exec were restored from savestate
	- [kevin] $1625/1626: buffering grayscale planes to avoid blinking in double-buffered games
	- [roms]  $1627: put all gscales extern into gscales.h
* Support for BSS section debugging (_nostub only at the moment). TIGCC 0.96 Beta 5 required.
* Avoid link port access when browsing memory in the Insight memory window as well (see $1588 above).
* Upgrade GTK+ for the Windows binaries to 2.6.8.
* Rebuild FC4 RPMs with the latest FC4 update GCC.
* FC4 RPMs no longer have a Conflicts: insight, because they don't conflict with Gerard Milmeister's Insight packages
* FC4 RPMs now build itcl/itk/iwidgets shared and provide them rather than conflicting with them.
* TiEmu, TiLP (roms): Added fvisibility support for GCC 3.4.2-rhl or 4.0 and higher
* Disabled fvisibility support if --enable-shared or --enable-shared-* because it is currently broken.
* libti*, TiLP (roms): Fixed GCC 4 pointer signedness warnings.
* libti* (PpHd): Fixed --enable-nls builds.
* libticables (roms): "Low-level access cable functions may be set to NULL on some cables: set to nul_cable instead." Was not done for the Gray Link !
* libticables (jb): Add a generic fallback case for all Linux hosts.
* libticables (roms): Removed arm/ipaq check for libusb removal. Can be removed by configure option.
* libticables (roms): Added ticable_link_reset function (needed by TiEmu for proper operation and present in ticables2).
* libticalcs (roms): Fixed possible buffer overflow with recv_packet (usually occurs with virtual links because the received length is invalid).

	- [roms] $1507: cleanup and little fixes in interrupt support of m68k
	- [roms] $1509: fixed behaviour of all keys and definitely fixed ON key

* libticables RPM: SilverLink support (based on Julien Blache's Debian packages and Nalin Dahyabhai's usbcam script)
* libticalcs: Fixed buffer overflow (fatal on FC4).
* TiLP: Fixed missing -Wl,--export-dynamic (FC4 fix, was in the spec file for 20050619).

20050619:
* Changes from TiEmu trunk:
	- [kevin] $1485/1486: replaced TiLP logo in the HTML manual with my temporary TiEmu logo
	- [roms] $1487: fixed resized window with key positions (mouse) (bug #1217627)
	- [roms] $1488: replaced current icon by Jaime's one
	- [roms] $1489: removed logo from about box
	- [jb]   $1493: src/gui/calc.c: screenshot of the whole calc in BW
		is not supported, error out in this case. It'd be nice to pop an
		error message to the user.
	- [jb]   $1493: src/misc/screenshot.c: enable BW screenshot in EPS
		and PDF; they're treated like color screenshots.
	- [roms] $1497: added hibou's logo

	                      Davidson's grayscale routine (bug #1207299)
	- [kevin] $1420/1421: when minimizing the main window, don't hide the others
	                      (patch #1209183)
	- [kevin] $1424/1425: fixed checkboxes in the program entry breakpoint
	                      dialog (a subtle 2-byte buffer overflow!)
	- [kevin] $1427/1428: RTC port triggers every 8192 seconds (correct), not every 4 (dbg code)
	- [kevin] $1430/1431: fixed resetting with the debugger open (closes the debugger
	                      rather than starting the engine with the debugger still expecting
	                      it to be stopped)
	- [kevin] $1432/1433: reenabled memory window refresh
* New Windows installer based on NSIS:
  - 7-Zip no longer needed for unpacking (TiEmu is still LZMA-compressed, but the NSIS installer
    can decompress it by itself)

  - The installer creates the appropriate menu entries.
* More changes for OS X support:
  - Force static linking for TCL-related stuff on OS X.
  - Don't chdir to $HOME (fixes Insight's path detection when running TiEmu using a relative path).
    (This one affects all *nix platforms, but Christian Walther noticed it on his OS X machine.)
* libticables (roms): AVR link support removed, baud_rate no longer exported
* libtifiles (roms): The file signature is now case-insensitive.
* TiLP (jb): Added EPS and PDF output for the screenshot.

20050522:
* changes from TiEmu trunk (synced with TiEmu 2.00 RC1):
	- [kevin] $1337/1338: fix --with-kde for Debian and derivatives
	- [kevin] $1340/1341: add -Wl,--export-dynamic for all Linux targets to fix Ubuntu problem
	- [kevin] $1351/1352: implement undocumented flags for ABCD, SBCD, NBCD and CHK
	                      (source: 68knotes.txt by Bart Trzynadlowski)
* added support for disassembling ER_throw (rev 1357, trunk backport pending)
* updated libticables and libtifiles version numbers (roms)
* some more OS X fixes (but OS X support is still not tested yet)

					 calculator type for now (part of memory management rewrite attempt)
	- [roms]  $1278: completely removed old memory banking system (mem_tab & mem_msk)
	- [roms]  $1293: fixed engine loop (every 30ms)
	- [roms]  $1294: can change LCD rate from popup menu

	- [kevin] $1231: allow setting a range breakpoint on a single byte
	- [kevin] $1232: fixed range breakpoint (overlap)
	- [roms]  $1233: fixed SSP/USP registers in registers.c
	- [roms]  $1234: 'exit & save state' moved in popup menu
	- [roms]  $1235: added accelator key to select & set PC on next line
	- [kevin] $1237/1238: don't clobber bkpts.id if we are already breaking
	- [kevin] $1239/1240: no FlashROM ghost space at 0x400000 on the TI-89
	- [kevin] $1239/1240: fixed hardwareRevision in the HW parameter block
	- [kevin] $1241/1242: fixed reads from wrong offsets in the stack window
In particular, these fix loading of AMS 2.09. Make sure you regenerate your images!
* Fix include paths for systems without BFD and readline installed.

* The TiLP and TiEmu RPMs now include menu entries (TiEmu can be found under "Development", TiLP under "Utilities"). Moreover, the TiLP RPM registers its file types properly now.

20050430:
First snapshot from tigcc-debugging-branch. New compared to the trunk snapshots: the GDB source debugger (command-line interface) has been integrated.
