[ In order to use TI's BlackLink serial cables or home-made serial or parallel
cables on any NT-based version of Windows (Windows NT 4, Windows 2000, Windows
XP, Windows 2003 or any newer version of Windows), you'll need to install the
DhaHelper driver. The installer for TiEmu 3 without GDB installs this driver
automatically. The installer for TiEmu 3 with GDB currently doesn't. ]

An easy way to install the above drivers is to install TiLP 2 for Windows.
For the other link cables / operating systems, no driver is needed.
