TiEmu is available for 2 platforms:
Linux (GTK), Windows (GTK).

If you have a SilverLink cable (TI-GRAPH LINK USB), you will need to retrieve
a Linux/Win32/Mac OS-X driver on the Linux Programmer Group at 
<http://lpg.ticalc.org/prj_usb>.

For the other link cables, no driver is needed because it's provided.


New capabilities:
-----------------

	- step out mode
	- disasm FLINE rom calls

	- show hexdump from source/code window
	- can disasm at address from memory window
	- can change several bytes at once in the mem window
	- can open a hexdump from register value
	- new window: stack
	- status register window (1 check button per bits)
	- searching capability in the mem window (90% done)

	- popup menu available even if the debugger is open and faster
	- can't step after bkpt: fixed
