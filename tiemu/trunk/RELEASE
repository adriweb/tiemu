				[ Release notes for TiEmu3 ]



Previous version: 3.01		(01/09/2007)
Current version:  3.02		(21/12/2007)

SubVersion (CVS) revision: $Id: RELEASE 2042 2006-05-07 07:46:23Z roms $

TiEmu is available for 3 platforms:
Linux (GTK), Windows (GTK), Mac OS X (GTK)

[ In order to use TI's BlackLink serial cables or home-made serial or parallel
cables on any NT-based version of Windows (Windows NT 4, Windows 2000, Windows
XP, Windows 2003 or any newer version of Windows), you'll need to install the
DhaHelper driver. The installer for TiEmu 3 without GDB installs this driver
automatically. The installer for TiEmu 3 with GDB currently doesn't. ]

An easy way to install the above drivers is to install TiLP 2 for Windows.
For the other link cables / operating systems, no driver is needed.


New capabilities:
-----------------

	- screenshot can be copied into clipboard
	- includes latest TiLP2 framework
	- single debugging window (VTi-style)
	- option to choose between multi-window (TiEmu < 3.02) and single-window (TiEmu >= 3.02)
	

Improvements:
-------------

	- added accelerator keys: F6 (code) and +/- (memory)
	- dual-click in register window select the whole register value now
	- mapped both CTRL keys to Diamond & both SHIFT keys to 2nd
	- added a popup menu with "View _memory" on any debugger window
	- unified displaying of hexadecimal values (removed '$' and ''0x' heading chars) in boxes
	- [no-gdb] suppress leading zeros in disasm like VTi does
	- [no-gdb] some instructions (trap, rts, reset...) was suffixed with .L which is not needed
	- [no-gdb] fixed wrong disassembly offset of MOVEM.L instruction
	- [no-gdb] fixed disassembly of MOVEP instruction
	- [no-gdb] fixed disassembly of MOVEQ instruction
	- [no-gdb] fixed disassembly of ori/andi/eori, addi/subi/cmpi, lea/rts instructions
	- [no-gdb] fixed disassembly of BT<tab>.W and changed BT into BRA
	- added accelerator keys (F1..F8) in memory window
	- map numerical ENTER key to TIKEY_ENTER on ti89
	- [no-gdb] unified displaying of hexadecimal values in the disassembler('$', '[' and '==' heading chars);
		displayed offset as signed values
	- [no-gdb] display "($42,a3),a3" instead of "(a3,$42),a3)" in disassembler
	- [no-gdb] reject computed value [%lX] at end of line rather than in the middle of the instruction
	- in the bkpts window, the fifth toolbar button (go to address) is not restricted to code
		breakpoint any longer; it works on any breakpoint type.
	- replaced currently selected instruction in code windows by an icon (arrow)
	- allow to change the font used in every debugger windows
	- [no-gdb] fixed disassembly of ori/andi/eori, addi/subi/cmpi, moveq/addq/subq instructions
	- [no-gdb] optimized m68k-disasm front-end
	- [no-gdb] fixed "movem.l #$unreadable_mask"
	- [gdb] Insight's GDB console is not shown by default anymore (less window clutter)
		
		
Bug fixes:
----------

	- [gdb] makeinfo version check
	- [gdb] longjmp out of gtk_main in the engine in the GDB-enabled version which triggered an assert with GLib 2.14
	- [gdb] relocation of debugging information for kernel-based programs
	- one-shot breakpoints which was not displayed any longer
	- one-shot breakpoint was never raised
