			[ Release notes ]



Previous version: 1.71 (2.00-a4)	(03/07/2004)
Current version:  1.72 (2.00-a6)	(12/07/2004)

SubVersion (CVS) revision: $Id$

TiEmu is available for 2 platforms:
Linux (GTK), Windows (GTK).

If you have a SilverLink cable (TI-GRAPH LINK USB), you will need to retrieve
a Linux/Win32/Mac OS-X driver on the Linux Programmer Group at 
<http://lpg.ticalc.org/prj_usb>.

For the other link cables, no driver is needed because it's provided.


New capabilities:
-----------------

	- dis-assembly window: use VTi syntax
	- VTi-style SR flags (don't reset)
	- save/restore bkpts with state image
	- symbolic debugger: code addresses are replaced by their counterpart name (ROM calls)


Improvements:
-------------

	- slow access to debugger
	- can navigate in the code window (up/down)
	- window focus & code window has default focus
	- some broken shortcuts (G => Go to address)
	- TI89 key mapping pbs (EE, |)
	- Alpha was not working properly
	- no key auto-repeat
	- handle long names with spaces in the ROM version box
	- ability to load weird updates (.89u)	
	- disable menu access when debugger is opened
	- ON key (and set on/off LCD screen)
	- error management
	- fixed 'restrict to current speed'
	- bugs in state image loading and LCD init: works fine now
	- linkport reworked but still buggy with HW2 (?!)
	- fixed code bkpt
	- ghost spaces
		

To do:
------

	- implement the Protection
	- implement the RTC introduced with AMS 2.09
