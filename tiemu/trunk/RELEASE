TiEmu is available for 2 platforms:
Linux (GTK), Windows (GTK).

If you have a SilverLink cable (TI-GRAPH LINK USB), you will need to retrieve
a Linux/Win32/Mac OS-X driver on the Linux Programmer Group at 
<http://lpg.ticalc.org/prj_usb>.

For the other link cables, no driver is needed because it's provided.


New capabilities:
-----------------

	- rewrite of the m68k loop:
		* UAE fixed to handle multiple pending interrupts and some other fixes
		* idle mode and STOP improved but problems with ON key


Improvements:
-------------

	- none
		

Bug fixes:
----------

	- fixed grayscale routines: they are now rock-stable !
	- fixed grayscales with HW2 (still use HW1 routine thru VTi detection)
	- implemented 'increment rate' of $600017 port
	- fixed AI3: it was never raised because counter was never incremented
	- port $700014 (Real Time Clock) is incremented every 8192 seconds
