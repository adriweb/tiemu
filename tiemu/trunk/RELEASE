			[ Release notes ]



Previous version: 2.00-rc6  (16/07/2005)
Current version:  2.00-rc7  (03/08/2005)

SubVersion (CVS) revision: $Id$

TiEmu is available for 3 platforms:
Linux (GTK), Windows (GTK), Mac OS-X (GTK)

[ If you have a SilverLink cable (TI-GRAPH LINK USB), you will need to retrieve
a Linux/Win32/Mac OS-X driver on the Linux Programmer Group at 
<http://lpg.ticalc.org/prj_usb>. ]

For the other link cables, no driver is needed.


New capabilities:
-----------------

	- added a new function in the ticables library API (ticable_link_reset)
		for use by TiEmu. It allows to reset/flush the pipes of virtual linking when the
		DBus is reset (usually due to transmission error). Link is now resumable.
	- reimplemented HW3 RTC from latest/new O. Armand's information (full support of clock now)


Improvements:
-------------

	- comm box (removed calc & autodetect because un-needed)
	- file patterns in file selector (case sensitivity)
	- avoid linkport accesses when browsing memory from dbg window
	- set link timeout to 60s for non-NT platforms, 1.5s for others
	- automatically bind virtual link 'TiEmu #2' on the second instance of TiEmu (Win32 only)
		

Bug fixes:
----------

	- PPhD's bug (no reload of ROM calls when upgrading)
	- severe bug in linkport (the status register was reset whenever read
		like specified by TI but the int handler proves it's false).
		TiEmu does not run an infinite loop when transfer is interrupted.
	

Planned:
--------

	- TiEmu v3.00 with GDB support

	
Notes:
------

	- the SilverLink cable doesn't make TiEmu crash any longer but it's still unusable
