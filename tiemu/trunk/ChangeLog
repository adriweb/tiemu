To do:
	- video scaling
	- link port is broken (HW2 only ?!)

	- popup menu slowed down in non-restricted speed mode (fixed)
	- removed lock-ups at startup (start engine after splash screen)

	- changed keyboard mapping to pure VTi mapping
	- added ability to load keymaps from file
	- force code window refresh when maintaining F7 key pressed

- 27/07/2004, version 1.75: roms
	Olivier's suggestions:
	- synch Code/Window menu with state of other windows (show/hide)
	- minimize/maximize all windows when touching calc or code window. Could be better...
	- can't step after bkpt: fixed.

	scratch !
	Debugger raised on event from m68k thread: less CPU intensive but 
	could be better.

- 30/06/2004, version 1.71: roms
	Lionel Debroux's suggestions:
	- debugger access is slow: improved by pre-loading windows.
	- can't scroll into the code window: fixed (VTi uses a fixed size list without scrollers)
	- window focus: fixed (list of the code window has default focus)
	- shortcuts (F2, G, ...): fixed
	- key mapping pb (EE, |): fixed
	- pb with Alpha key: fixed
	- no key auto-repeat: fixed
	- long names with the ROM version box: fixed

	- SR flags (VTi emulation): fixed

	Fixes:
	- disable menu access when debugger is opened.
	- I/O bits manipulation functions moved into bits.h and fixed (bit_set/clr buggy) but
		direct file loading is now broken.

	Improvements:
	- added VTi-style disassembly view
