DESCRIPTION
       The TiEmu program allows you to emulate a Texas Instruments calculators
       such  as  a  TI89,  TI92, TI92+ or V200PLT gand-held.  The emulator has
       also a virtual link capability which allows to connect  it  to  another
       program (such as a linking program for instance).

OPTIONS
       The command line options override the default options (startup options)
       and the config file options even.   The  TiEmu  accepts  the  following
       options:

       -h, --help
              Display a list of all command line options.

       -v, --version
              Output the version info.

       -rom_file=
              Load  the  specified ROM image. Must be a valid TI89/92/92+/V200
              ROM image.

       -sav_file=
              Load the specified state file. Must be a valid  TI89/92/92+/V200
              state image.

CONFIG FILE FORMAT
       This section describes the format of the .tiemu config file which is in
       the home directory of the user (Linux). A line preceded by the '#' sym-
       bol  is  a  comment.   Each line has the following format: option=some-
       thing.  The config file must have the 'RC_END' string  at  end.   Every
       line  can  be put in any order.  Take in mind that any comment added in
       the config file will be overwritten.  Below is  described  each  option

       adr_port= places the I/O address of the I/O port  to  use.  It  can  be
