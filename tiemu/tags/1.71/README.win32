REQUIREMENTS
------------

 - a Windows computer: Windows 95/98/Me or Windows NT4/2000/XP
 - the GTK+ 2.x libraries (new package)
    Location: http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/gtk-win/GTK-Runtime-Environment-2.2.4-2.exe?download
 - the SilverLink driver v3.x if you have a SilverLink cable
	Location: http://www.ticalc.org/pub/win/link/tiglusbinf3.zip


NOTES
-----

1°) You need some extra libraries 
(GTK+ 2.0). The GTK+ package includes the Wimp (Windows IMPersonator) theme 
engine which gives Windows look & feel (includes XP theming). Note: disabled on 
non-NT systems.

2°) If you have a SilverLink cable (TI-GRAPH LINK USB), you will need to retrieve
the Win32 driver on the Linux Programmer Group at http://lpg.ticalc.org/prj_usb.

Simply plug your link cable: Windows should detect a new device. Next, follow the
installation instructions.

You can install driver at any time (that is to say before or after TiLP installation).

Given that the LPG SilverLink driver has a Release date more recent than the Texas
Instruments OEM driver, this driver will be used prior to the TI one.

3°) This setup will install the PortTalk driver (Windows NT4/2000/XP machines).
This step may require an administrator account (at least for NT4).
You will need to REBOOT your machine after installation (if you plan to 
use a parallel or serial link cable).

4°) This setup will modify your AUTOEXEC.BAT (Windows 9x/Me) to speed-up 
GTK+ 2.0 rendering. It should be better to REBOOT your machine after the first
installation...
