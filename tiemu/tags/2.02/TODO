Planned features:

- add SilverLink support

- register window
- Kevin: <<> what do you think of a new window which will display the various register
of the hardware ?

Sounds good, but we really, really need to decide on what windows to show by
default in the debugger, and have a way to remember the windows which were
open next time the debugger is launched (as Insight does it). Showing all
windows by default simply doesn't scale.

- RTC HW2 to fix (clock wrap around)
