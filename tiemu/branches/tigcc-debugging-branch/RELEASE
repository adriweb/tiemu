TiEmu is available for 2 platforms:
Linux (GTK), Windows (GTK).

If you have a SilverLink cable (TI-GRAPH LINK USB), you will need to retrieve
a Linux/Win32/Mac OS-X driver on the Linux Programmer Group at 
<http://lpg.ticalc.org/prj_usb>.

For the other link cables, no driver is needed because it's provided.


New capabilities:
-----------------

	- added instruction cycle count support


Improvements:
-------------

	- merged UAE 0.8.15 from tigcc-dbg branch
	- restrict to actual speed based on cycle count, not instruction count.
	- added pgm_entry bkpt support in dbg_cause.c
	- browser launching
	-  trigger interrupts per cycle, not per instruction. Fix interrupt rates. 
		Measure LCD exposure times in cycles rather than instructions to match the timers.
