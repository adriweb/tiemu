20050529:

	                      Davidson's grayscale routine (bug #1207299)
	- [kevin] $1420/1421: when minimizing the main window, don't hide the others
	                      (patch #1209183)
	- [kevin] $1424/1425: fixed checkboxes in the program entry breakpoint
	                      dialog (a subtle 2-byte buffer overflow!)
	- [kevin] $1427/1428: RTC port triggers every 8192 seconds (correct), not every 4 (dbg code)
	- [kevin] $1430/1431: fixed resetting with the debugger open (closes the debugger
	                      rather than starting the engine with the debugger still expecting
	                      it to be stopped)
	- [kevin] $1432/1433: reenabled memory window refresh
* New Windows installer based on NSIS:

    can decompress it by itself)
  - GTK+ is downloaded and installed automatically (after user confirmation) if needed.
  - The installer creates the appropriate menu entries.
* More changes for OS X support:
  - Force static linking for TCL-related stuff on OS X.
  - Don't chdir to $HOME (fixes Insight's path detection when running TiEmu using a relative path).
    (This one affects all *nix platforms, but Christian Walther noticed it on his OS X machine.)
* libticables (roms): AVR link support removed, baud_rate no longer exported
* libtifiles (roms): The file signature is now case-insensitive.
* TiLP (jb): Added EPS and PDF output for the screenshot.

	                      (source: 68knotes.txt by Bart Trzynadlowski)
* added support for disassembling ER_throw (rev 1357, trunk backport pending)
* updated libticables and libtifiles version numbers (roms)

	- [roms]  $1233: fixed SSP/USP registers in registers.c
	- [roms]  $1234: 'exit & save state' moved in popup menu
	- [roms]  $1235: added accelator key to select & set PC on next line
	- [kevin] $1237/1238: don't clobber bkpts.id if we are already breaking
	- [kevin] $1239/1240: no FlashROM ghost space at 0x400000 on the TI-89
	- [kevin] $1239/1240: fixed hardwareRevision in the HW parameter block

In particular, these fix loading of AMS 2.09. Make sure you regenerate your images!
* Fix include paths for systems without BFD and readline installed.
* Reenable the debugger if it has previously been disabled (by GDB).
* libtifiles fixed to allow loading AMS 2.05 as originally distributed by TI (not really a valid 89u file, but other programs accept it) (roms).
* libtifiles and libticalcs compile fixes for OS X (Christian Walther).
* The TiLP and TiEmu RPMs now include menu entries (TiEmu can be found under "Development", TiLP under "Utilities"). Moreover, the TiLP RPM registers its file types properly now.

First snapshot from tigcc-debugging-branch. New compared to the trunk snapshots: the GDB source debugger (command-line interface) has been integrated.
