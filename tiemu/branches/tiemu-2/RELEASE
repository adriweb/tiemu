TiEmu is available for 3 platforms:
Linux (GTK), Windows (GTK), Mac OS-X (GTK)

[ If you have a SilverLink cable (TI-GRAPH LINK USB), you will need to retrieve
a Linux/Win32/Mac OS-X driver on the Linux Programmer Group at 
<http://lpg.ticalc.org/prj_usb>. ]

For the other link cables, no driver is needed.


New capabilities:
-----------------

	- none (TiEmu 2.xx is a stable branch).


Improvements:
-------------

	- pedrom v0.81
	- optimized grayscale movem detection and added support for dirty-coded HW2/3 grayscale 
		interrupts abusing the stack pointer to hold data (currently only the latest Grib is 
		known to do that).
	
		
Bug fixes:
----------

	- bug #1304338: doesn't save skinless mode in .ini file
	- bug #1305054: doesn't refresh vector bkpt state
	- reverted back to GTK+ 2.6
	

Planned:
--------

	- TiEmu v3.00 with GDB support

	
Notes:
------

	- the SilverLink cable doesn't make TiEmu crash any longer but it's still unusable
	- this is the last RC release !
