Planned features:

Hello, I've created skins of my own and used other people's for use on TIEMU.
While the skin on SKINEDIT looks fine, it loses much resolution when it is used
by TIEMU. As a check, I used the same skins and exported them to VTI2.5's format...
They look just fine on VTI, the same they do as with SKINEDIT. Why is it that
TIEMU cannot render the full resolution or is there something I'm doing wrong?
Thanks
