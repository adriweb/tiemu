REQUIREMENTS (Win32)
--------------------

 - a PC with a 450MHz Pentium-class processor and 32MB of RAM
 - a Windows computer: Windows 95/98/Me or Windows NT4/2000/XP (better)
 - the GTK+ 2.6 libraries
    Location: <http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/gladewin32/gtk-win32-2.6.8-rc1.exe?download>
	
	Note: if you are using GiMP, you don't need to get this GTK+ package, they are compatible.


INSTALLATION (Win32)
--------------------

Run the InnoSetup installer...

1°) You need some extra libraries (GTK+ 2.6). 

The GTK+ package includes the Wimp (Windows IMPersonator) theme engine which gives 
Windows look & feel (includes XP theming). Is also included the GTK theme selector.
You may need to use it on non-NT systems if you get a lot of warnings about a font. 
Simply disable the WiMP theme for another one.

2°) If anyone is getting one of these:
- ** WARNING **: Couldn't load font "MS Sans Serif 8" falling back to "Sans 8"
- ** ERROR **: file shape.c line 75: assertion failed: (glyphs->num_glyphs > 0)
or any other warning or error message regarding fonts/glyphs, the fix is to
open your C:\Program Files\Shared Files\Gtk\2.0\etc\gtk-2.0\gtkrc and to add this:
	style "user-font"
	{
	font_name="Arial"
	}
	widget_class "*" style "user-font"
This forces GTK+ to use a compatible font (Arial) and reportedly fixes both
the aforementioned problems, and probably others too.
